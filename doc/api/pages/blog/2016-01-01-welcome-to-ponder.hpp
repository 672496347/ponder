\par **ponder** *synonyms*: reflect on

Ponder is a fork of [CAMP][1], which reached the end of its life. Ponder 1.0 keeps the same API as CAMP, but makes some changes, like removing the Boost dependency, instead using C++11 features.

CAMP was originally released, by [Tegesoft][2], under the LGPL licence, but this changed to the MIT licence in version 0.8. Ponder retains the same licence.
